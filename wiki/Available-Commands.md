# Available Commands
The are a lot of available commands. In the future we hope to generate this documentation, by
having Sphinx Documentation of the CommandSequence.

For now please have a look at [CommandSequence.py](../automation/CommandSequence.py) and look through
all methods on the `CommandSequence` class.
